  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying docker images using [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) as default. 

  This charm simplifies docker image deployment management, 
  allowing us to inject variables to the environment as we see fit. It allows for deployment on
  many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) to
  [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) to public cloud Kubernetes
  offerings.

  As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their docker images, 
  use them in a juju environment without having to write a charm from scratch and gives them the
  freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

  For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make docker image testing easier and more manageable. 
  It will allow easy deployment into multiple environments for testing of changes,
  and supports scaling out for enterprise deployments.
